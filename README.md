# Repo for Evaluation of Online DF$^2$ Graph Discovery

## How to Perform Evaluation
The raw data on which the evaluation of the proposed method is based is contained in the files `evaluation/evaluation_results.csv` and `evaluation/parameter_search_results.csv`.

### Evaluated Event Logs
Below is a summary of the statistics of the six evaluated event logs:

| Log File | Events | Activities | Objects |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `age_of_empires_ocel2.json` | 2,372,505 | 829 | 361,935 |
| `logistics.json` | 35,413 | 14 | 13,910 |
| `lrmsCollection.json` | 28,278 | 22 | 8,819 |
| `order-management.json` | 21,008 | 11 | 10,840 |
| `procureToPay.json` | 14,671 | 10 | 9,543 |
| `reasoning_benchmark.json` | 31,709 | 32 | 1,645 |

They can be reproduced as follows:

1. **Place the Event Logs:**
   Create the `evaluation_ocels/` directory in the project root. Copy and paste the required OCEL log files into the `evaluation_ocels/` (These files are not tracked in git due to size constraints).

2. **Run the Evaluation Tests:**
   Navigate to the `backend/` directory and execute the respective tests:

   * **Full Stream Evaluation:**
     To evaluate per-event processing times, memory usage, and structural conformance over the stream across all logs, run:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     cargo test --release run_full_evaluation -- --ignored --nocapture
     ```
     This generates `evaluation/evaluation_results.csv`.

   * **Parameter Grid Search Evaluation:**
     To run the grid search across different combinations of $T_{\text{hint}}$ and $T_{\text{max}}$ configurations, run:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     cargo test --release run_unified_parameter_search_evaluation -- --ignored --nocapture
     ```
     This generates `evaluation/parameter_search_results.csv`.

The tests automatically save the output CSV files directly into the `evaluation/` directory in the project root.

## How to Visualize Results
To regenerate all results from the evaluation CSV files:

```bash
cd evaluation
.venv/bin/python3 visualize_all.py
```

## Folder Structure

### 1. Processing Time and Scalability (`plots/exp1_time/`)
- **Stability** (`Plot_A_Stability.png`): Boxplots and scatter plots showing the distribution of per-event processing times across all logs.
- **Scalability** (`Plot_B_Scalability.png`): Combined plot showing processing time vs. event index for representative logs (Age of Empires & Order Management).
- **Scalability Individual**: Folder containing scalability plots for every individual log.

### 2. Memory and Validity (`plots/exp2_memory_validity/`)
- **Global Tradeoff** (`Plot_C_Global_Tradeoff.png`): Aggregate plot showing the global relationship between memory savings and structural deviation (FP/FN) with a combined legend.
- **Memory Dynamics** (`Plot_D_Memory_Dynamics.png`): Combined plot showing memory consumption for representative logs (without scientific notation on x-axis).
- **Memory Dynamics Individual**: Folder containing memory dynamics plots for every individual log.
- **Recovery Curve** (`Plot_E_Recovery_Curve.png`): Combined plot showing structural deviation recovery over time for representative logs.
- **Recovery Curve Individual**: Folder containing recovery curve plots for every individual log.
- **Combined Memory & Accuracy** (`Plot_DE_Memory_Accuracy.png`): Combined side-by-side plots for representative logs showcasing absolute memory dynamics and structural deviation over event indices.
- **Metrics Table** (`Table_Performance_Metrics.tex`): LaTeX table summarizing drift and memory metrics per log.

### 3. Parameter Search (`plots/exp3_parameters/`)
- **Pareto Frontier** (`Plot_F_Pareto_Frontier.png`): Detailed Pareto frontier for all logs, including sweet-spot annotations with inactivity ranges and optimized placement.

## Requirements
- Rust
- Python 3.9+
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy



# SCOPE

SCOPE is an open-source software project which allows the user to discover and explore object-centric processes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Rust
-   Node.js: Version 22.19.0 or higher

### Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BPM-Research-Group/scope
    cd scope
    ```

2.  Set up Environment Variables:
    -   The application requires environment variables, located in `.env`, to run. We've included the required variables in an example file.

        ```
        cp .env.dev.example .env
        ```

3.  Install Frontend Dependencies:
    -   Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
    -   Install the necessary packages: `npm install`

### Running the Application

To use SCOPE, you'll need to run both the backend and frontend servers.

1.  Start the Backend Server:
    -   Navigate to the `backend` directory from the project root.
    -   Start up the backend server: `cargo run` (This may take a while on your first execution, as it is installing the required backend dependencies)
    -   The backend API will be running in the background and accepts requests at this URL: `http://localhost:3000`

2.  Start the Frontend Server:
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    -   Start the development server: `npm run dev`
    -   You can now access the SCOPE application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
